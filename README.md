# 8080 CPU Chip Emulator

This is a solo project I began after my freshmen year of college to furthur explore how a simple CPU functions. I did this by emulating the first commercial 8-bit proccessor which was used for the original Space Invaders arcade game. I began this project by reading thorugh the 8080 manual learning all the registers, clock cycles, and opcodes needed to begin this project. Thorughout this project I ran learned the how registers store data and calculate equations through basic addition, subtraction, and bit manipulation. 

# Problems faced

Some issues I have run into working on this project so far is code orginization as I learned to turn certain opcodes into functions to be called since they were repeated opcodes with different registers.

# Future scope 

In the future it would be fun to finish the full machine template emulation including buttons, display, and sound. After this I could extract the ROM file from the game and have the full Space Invaders game emulated and playable on my local device.
